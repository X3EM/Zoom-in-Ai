ABSTRACT
A gecko foot-inspired, mushroom-shaped artificial dry adhesive exploiting intermolecular forces 
between microstructure and surface has drawn research attention for its strong adhesive force. 
However, the high pull-off strength corresponding to the adhesive force matters when detaching 
fragile substrates. In this study, we report a vacuum-powered soft actuator having oblique air 
chambers and a dry adhesive. The soft actuator performs coupled contraction and twisting by 
applying negative pneumatic pressure inward and exhibits not only high pull-off strength but 
also easy detachment. This effective detachment can be achieved thanks to the twisting motion 
of the soft actuator. The detachment performances of the actuator models are assessed using 
a 6-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. Results show that the soft actuators exhibit remarkable pull- 
off strength decrement from ~20 N cm−2 to ~2 N cm−2 due to the twisting. Finally, to verify 
a feasible application of this study, we utilize the inherent compliance of the actuators and 
introduce a glass transfer system for which a glass substrate on a slope is gripped by the flexibility 
of the soft actuators and delivered to the destination without any fracture.

climb vertical surfaces or even move upside down on a ceiling at speeds of up to 77 cm s−1. The key feature of 
a gecko’s astonishing adhesion lies in the micro-setae 
on their toes. Each micro-seta, approximately 100 μm

keratin, and its tip branches into spatulae consisting 
of stalks with flat triangular ends. When the setae are 
planted on a surface, intermolecular surface forces, such 
as the van der Waals force, are generated at the inter -
face, which is strong enough to exceed the entire weight 
of a lizard [1–5]. To utilize the adhesion mechanism of 
a gecko’s foot, studies have proposed the use of mush -
room-shaped artificial dry adhesives consisting of 
a hierarchical bilayer comprising micropillars and tips, 
which exhibit good adhesion, repeatability, and self- 
cleaning capability compared to nanostructures with 
simple spatulate tips [6–11 ]. Given these advantages, 
glass transfer systems with dry adhesive have been 
introduced to deliver a heavy, wide, thin glass with 
a robot arm or a gripper [10,12–14 ]. However, the 
high pull-off strength derived from detachment in the 
vertical direction can damage or even fracture a fragile 
glass substrate, such as a wide and thin liquid crystal 
display. To detach the dry adhesive with low pull-off 
strength, the application of shear force on the interface 
has been introduced [15–20 ]. This method decreases 
the pull-off strength, as it induces a peeling effect of the 
micropillars and reduces the real contact area of the 
attached glass. Inspired by this principle, a novel 
detachment method has been introduced, which exerts 
shear force on the interface by twisting the dry adhesive, 
thus generating a low pull-off strength that is approxi -
mately half to the detachment in the vertical direc -
tion [21].
These days, research in terms of ‘robotics’ have 
been actively carried out with the development of 
software such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML), and various studies related 
to ‘soft robots’ have also been conducted. Unlike con-
ventional robots for routine practices with restricted 
environment, soft robots feature versatile shape defor -
mation and high adaptability in various environments 
[22–25 ]. Furthermore, unlike conventional hard 
robots constructed with barely deformable substances, 
such as metal and aluminum alloy, soft robots deform 
themselves and exhibit a wide range of motions, such 
as swimming, crawling, and galloping, in response to 
their inherent compliance with their base materials 
[26–30 ]. Among soft robots, a soft pneumatic actuator 
is one of the popular actuating methods. It is generally 
fabricated using flexible materials, such as silicone 
rubber, and typically includes embedded monolithic 
air network with multiply connected air chambers. By 
applying pneumatic pressure on the network, the 
actuator can perform complex motions such as exten -
sion, contraction, bending, and twisting [31–37 ]. 
Utilizing these smart actuators, research have been 
conducted to grip and convey smooth glasses [38– 
40] in recent years. However, rupture of the glass 
owing to excessive pull-off force was not sincerely 
considered in the previous studies yet.In this study, we report a vacuum-powered soft 
actuator with the mushroom-shaped artificial dry 
adhesive, as shown in Figure 1. The actuator exhibits 
not only strong adhesion but also easy detachment 
with glass and contains oblique air chambers that 
can be deformed easily by controlling air pressure. 
Several models focusing on the influence of the angle 
of air chambers and dimension were demonstrated 
through a characteristic equation governing the design 
of the actuators, and prototypes were fabricated with 
the dry adhesive using soft lithography. The perfor -
mances of the actuator models, such as high pull-off 
strength and easy detachment, were verified with 
a 6-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot arm. Then, 
the results were compared with previous soft glass 
grippers focusing on pull-off force and its switching. 
Finally, a novel glass transfer system that can attach 
a tilted glass by bending and safely detach after deliv -
ery was also introduced as a feasible application.
2.Experimental sections
2.1. Fabrication of the artificial dry adhesive 
inspired by the gecko foot
The gecko-inspired, mushroom-shaped artificial dry 
adhesive was fabricated through conventional soft 
lithography with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
(Figure S1) [7]. First, the elastomer base and curing 
agent (Sylgard 184 kit, Dow Corning Corp, U.S.A.) 
were mixed in a ratio of 10:1, and the PDMS mixture 
was degassed to remove air bubbles in the vacuum 
chamber. Then, the degassed PDMS mixture was 
poured onto a master mold with mushroom-shaped 
microstructures and cured in a 70°C oven for 2 h. The 
cured PDMS was carefully demolded from the master 
mold (Supplementary Figures S1(a–c)). The total 
thickness of the sample was controlled at ~2 mm, 
and each micropillar had a height of 20 μm, diameter 
of 10 μm, tip thickness of 1 μm, and tip diameter of 13  
μm. The pillar arrays were arrayed in a hexagonal 
pattern 20 μm away from each pillar’s center.
2.2. Preparation of the vacuum-powered soft 
actuator
Vacuum-powered soft actuator models were fabri -
cated by employing a simple process of soft litho -
graphy depicted in Supplementary Figure S2. The 
mold for the soft actuator body was produced by 
a digital light processing-type 3D printer with ultra -
violet light-curable resin and overcured for 12 h after 
printing to increase the solidity of the molds 
(Supplementary Figures S2(a-i)). Then, the left and 
right parts of the mold were slightly joined together, 
and the degassed PDMS mixture was poured on it 
(Supplementary Figure S2(a-ii)). After an additional Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 24 (2023) 2                                                                                                                                                     S. H. YOO et al.30 minutes of deaeration, the mold was completely 
assembled and cured in the 70°C oven for 2 h 
(Supplementary Figure S2(a-iii)). Half of the soft 
actuator body was fabricated through this process, 
and it was repeated for the other. The fabricated two 
halves were assembled back-to-back, and the actua -
tor body was completely fabricated (Supplementary 
Figures S2a(iv and v)). Finally, by firmly bonding the 
artificial dry adhesive with a 1.7-mm-thick thin glass 
(weight: 12 g) on the top of the soft actuator, the 
preparation of the vacuum-powered soft actuator 
was finished (Supplementary Figure S2(b)).
2.3. Experimental setup with a 6-DOF robot arm
The detachment experiments of the soft actuator mod -
els were conducted to measure the generated pull-off 
strength using custom-built equipment. A 6-DOF 
robot arm (MZ07, Nachi, Japan), actuator models, an 
Arduino-based pneumatic pump kit, and load cell sensors on which a glass was fixed were prepared for 
the tests. In all experiments, the soft actuator was 
assembled with the robot arm and was in contact 
conformally with the glass. At first, after a preload of 
5 N cm−2 was given to the dry adhesive by the robot 
arm before the initiation of each implement 
(Supplementary Figure S3(a)), the robot arm lifted 
the glass with a velocity of 0.5 mm s−1 to apply 
a normal force in a vertical direction on the interface 
between the dry adhesive and glass (Supplementary 
Figure S3(b)). Second, the soft actuator was operated 
by applying negative pneumatic pressure by the pump 
kit after 1 s from the initiation to induce contraction 
and twisting on the interface at the same time 
(Supplementary Figures S3(c,d)). During the experi -
ment, pull-off strength and applied negative air pres-
sure were evaluated simultaneously with a sampling 
time interval of 100 ms. Through 10 iterations, the 
average value was obtained and then used in the 
experimental data. If the dry adhesive was successfully

repeated after increasing its diameter. Otherwise, the 
model was excluded from further measurements.
3.Results and discussion
3.1. Design of the soft actuator
The soft actuator in this article was based on finger- 
shaped structures, and the artificial dry adhesive having 
a strong adhesion was assembled at the end of the soft 
actuator. Figure 1 provides an overview of the entire soft 
actuator. As depicted in Figure 1(a,b) , once the pneu -
matic force is applied to the soft actuator, a twisting 
motion of the soft actuator is induced, and torque is 
generated. The dry adhesive is composed of hierarchical 
microstructures resembling a ‘mushroom’ shape, and 
according to the literature, a twisting motion facilitates 
the easy detachment of dry adhesive [21]. Therefore, easy 
detachment of the dry adhesive can be achieved using the 
twisting motion. This facile mechanism would be 
explained later in detail. First of all, to select the base 
material for the soft actuator, a consideration of stiffness 
was needed. Due to the high adhesion of the dry adhe -
sive, high stress must be exerted from soft pneumatic 
actuators to detach the artificial dry adhesive [7]. Given 
that PDMS features higher stiffness (Young’s modulus =  
~1.8 MPa) compared to EcoFlex (Young’s modulus =  
~0.1 MPa), which is a well-established silicone elastomer 
for soft pneumatic actuators, the PDMS was selected as 
the base material in this study [41].
The next part is about the twisting motion of the 
soft actuator, which is the key feature of this study. As 
Mosadegh’s work demonstrated [31], a finger-shaped 
actuator with an integrated pneumatic system consist -
ing of a single main channel and air chambers exhibits 
bending when pneumatic pressure is internally applied. In accordance with finite element analysis 
and the experimental results found in the literature, 
the soft pneumatic actuators with oblique air cham -
bers could exhibit coupled bending and twisting 
[34,42]. Furthermore, the overlapped arrays of equiva -
lent air chambers achieve a higher twisting angle com -
pared to the arrays located side by side [33]. From 
these backgrounds, each soft actuator model is 
designed to be overlapped by the same halves, embed 
a pneumatic network with oblique air chambers, and 
generate normal force and torque derived from 
coupled contraction and twisting when negative pneu -
matic pressure is applied. As shown in Figures 1(d), 
the soft actuator has successfully shown various twist -
ing motions according to the pressure.
Figure 2 shows the whole information of the soft 
actuator and various design parameters in detail. In 
particular, Figure 2(a) presents the finger shape with 
a cross-sectional area of 20 mm × 20 mm and height of 
100 mm. As can be seen, each actuator has a space for 
a main void in the middle of the structure and air 
chambers of oblique shape. The same halves of the 
actuator are stacked together to offset bending and 
induce twisting when pneumatic pressure is applied 
inward. Other fixed design parameters of the actuator 
models are as follows: the height of the air chamber 
(h = 6 mm), the height of the main void (hO = 3 mm), 
wall thickness between the outside part and air cham -
ber (t = 1 mm), the width of air chamber (b = 5 mm), 
and wall thickness between the pneumatic network 
and outside part (t0 = 3 mm and t1 = 2 mm).
Based on the fixed parameters, the soft actuators 
were tuned by determining several variable para -
meters. Figure 2(b) shows the top side of a model 
that is visible on the inward edges of air chambers. 
The characteristic equation that governs the geogra -
phy of each model is as follows: 
Figure 2. Schematic view of the design of a soft pneumatic actuator. (a) The fixed design parameters of an actuator model. (b) The 
variable design parameters of the actuator model. (c) The proposed models with air chamber angle (i) θ = 45°, (ii) θ = 60°, and (iii) 
θ = 75°, respectively.Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 24 (2023) 4                                                                                                                                                     S. H. YOO et al.2sb2N1Wtan 90� θL (1) 
where θ is the angle of air chambers and N and s are 
the numbers of air chambers and distance s at the 
edge, respectively.
To investigate the effect of angle θ, N and s were 
determined after θ. Table 1 presents the values of s and 
N corresponding to the specific value of θ from θ = 15° 
to 75° at a fixed value of L = 100 mm. The designs of 
angle θ = 0° and 90° were excluded because only con-
traction occurred without twisting when vacuum pres-
sure was applied [34,43]. The designs of angle values θ = 15° and 30° were also excluded as they contained 
low numbers of N. As a result, three models of θ = 45°, 
60°, 75° are proposed, as shown in Figure 2(c).
3.2. Performance of the soft actuator
The results of the pull-off strength derived from the 
detachment experiments of the dry adhesive are 
shown based on its diameter and on the vacuum 
pressure applied on the models in Figure 3. The graphs 
exhibit the curve between time and measured pull-off 
strength of each actuator model based on the different 
diameters of the dry adhesives (8, 9, 10, and 12 mm). 
When the dry adhesives are lifted by the robot arm 
following a normal direction without air actuation, the 
pull-off strength gradually increases from zero to max -
imum value during the detachment process and 
returns to zero after the process is completed. The Table 1. Information for the geography of various soft

N cm−2 for the dry adhesive with a diameter of 8 mm 
and slightly increased by up to ~21, 23, and 26 N cm−2 
as the diameter of the dry adhesive increases by 9, 10, 
and 12 mm, respectively. In cases of successful detach -
ment by air actuations, the pull-off strength gradually 
increases to the maximum value and decreases after 
passing the apex. As the diameter increases, the max -
imum pull-off strength of the actuator models θ = 60° 
and 75° increases from 1.6 to 2.0 N cm−2 and from 3.0 
to 3.8 N cm−2, respectively, representing approxi -
mately 8% and 15% of the normal detachment for 
each. Meanwhile, the pull-off strength increases to 
a certain extent and remains constant when the 
detachment fails. The actuator model of 45° manages 
to detach the dry adhesive of diameter 8 mm, whereas 
the 9 mm specimen is not taken off (Figure 3(a,b )). 
Similarly, the 60° and 75° models can detach the 10  
mm sample but not the one of 12 mm (Figure 3(c,d )). 
As shown in Figure 3(e), a relatively low pull-off 
strength is measured in each case of actuation com -
pared to the detachment without actuation. This is 
a remarkable result, which demonstrates that easy 
detachment could be achieved by operating the soft 
actuator. Figure 4 shows the detailed relations between 
pull-off strength and vacuum pressure applied to the 
actuators in the cases of the conformal detachment of 
the dry adhesive samples upon their diameters. The 
pull-off strength increases steadily until the detachment as the absolute value of the applied air 
pressure increases (Figures 4(a,c )). Moreover, for the 
same actuator model, lower air pressure is required to 
detach the dry adhesive as its diameter increases. 
Although both 60° and 75° models can detach the 8, 
9, and 10 mm samples, a higher value of the applied air 
pressure is required for the 75° model to detach the 
dry adhesive compared to the 60° model. In detail, the 
75° model successfully detached the 10 mm sample at 
the pressure of 31 kPa, while the 60° model demanded 
18 kPa.
3.3. Analysis of the easy detachment
When vacuum pressure is applied to the soft actua -
tors, the walls of oblique air chambers collapse 
inward and lead to tension. The vertical and hori-
zontal components of the tensions cause the actua -
tors to contract and twist, thus providing the 
interface with coupled normal stress and shear 
stress, respectively [35,44]. As shown in 
Figure 5(a), in two dimensions, a second-order stress 
tensor at the center of a micropillar can be written as 
follows: 
σσzτxy
τxy 0��
στ
τ0��
C (2) 
where σzσ is the normal stress in the vertical direc -
tion, and τxyτ is the shear stress horizontal to the 
Figure 4. Graph of the pull-off strength versus applied negative air pressure until detachment of (a) 8, (b) 9, and (c) 10 mm-thick 
specimens.Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 24 (2023) 6                                                                                                                                                     S. H. YOO et al.center of a top of the micropillar applied by the 
coupled motions. For the detachment of each micro -
pillar, the relationship between σ and τ at the moment 
of its detachment can be described by an equation of 
Mohr’s circle given by: 
σ
2��2
τ2R2C (3) 
where R is the value of maximum in-plane shear stress 
for detachment. When a pillar is detached in the 
vertical direction without shear stress, Equation (3) 
can be modified as follows: 
σ0
2��2
R2C (4) 
where σ0 is pull-off strength of each micropillar. By sub-
stituting Equation (4) into (Equation 3), the relationship 
between the σ and τ, which is required for the detachment 
and the pull-off strength, can be described as follows: 
σ
2��2
τ2σ0
2��2
B (5) 
Therefore, the micropillar can be detached when the 
complex stresses increase and reach a value exceeding 
σ0. Figure 5(a) shows the schematic of the interface 
between microtips and a glass after the application of 
different twisting angles. In elastic region, shear stress 
can be expressed by,  
τGγ (6) 
where G is shear modulus, and γ is shear strain.
From equation 6, shear stress is proportional to the 
value of shear strain. Therefore, the twisting motion results in an increase in shear stress, which leads to a 
reduction in pull-off strength. Also, due to the increase 
in shear stress, crack propagation was initiated (Figure 
5(b–d) ). The crack propagates as the motions con-
tinue, thus decreasing the pull-off strength of dry 
adhesive, which is proportional to the number of 
micropillars in contact with the glass [21,45]. As 
a result, the micropillars end up with elastic bending 
(Figure 5(e)), and the facile detachment can be 
achieved by low pull-off strength.
To detach the dry adhesive with the low pull-off 
strength, shear stress applied to the dry adhesive must 
exceed the threshold region at which the bonds rup-
ture and detachment occurs [15,19]. As the value of 
the chamber angle θ increases, the cross-section of the 
air chambers increases, and it may result in the 
increased torsional stiffness of the soft actuator [35]. 
Thus, a relatively high magnitude of negative pneu -
matic pressure is required for the model of angle 75° to 
exceed the region and high pull-off strength is gener -
ated when the dry adhesive is finally detached. In the 
case of the model of angle 45°, despite the reduced 
torsional stiffness, the 45° angle model exhibits lower 
controllable adhesion energy compared to the 60° and 
75° angle models. When the width of the air chambers 
is normalized by the length of the side wall (cEe) 
depicted in Figure 2(b,c ), the cEe of the 45° angle 
model is about twice as high as the others. Perhaps, 
this leads to the contact of the side walls having a low- 
magnitude vacuum pressure and tensions derived 
from the walls remaining constant [44,46]. As 
a result, the model can exert low stress upon the dry 
adhesive and exhibit low controllable adhesion energy.

Based on the above experiments, a soft actuator 
applied-glass transfer system with a 6-DOF robot arm 
was suggested as a feasible application as shown in 
Figure 6. In the time-lapse images, the actuator came 
into contact with the tilted glass and picked it up by 
adapting the 10° angle of the slope due to the flexibility 
of the soft actuator (Figures 6(a,b )). Then, the glass was 
lifted while attached to the dry adhesive and delivered to 
a particular site as the robot arm moved horizontally 
(Figures 6(c,d )). When the glass arrived on the site, it 
was anchored on the bottom, which was coated by 
a double-sided tape. The fix glass was detached from 
the dry adhesive as negative air pressure was applied to 
the actuator (Figures 6(e,f )). Through the system, the 
glass substrate was safely transferred without fall and 
fracture during the transfer.
5.Conclusion
In this study, we introduced a novel vacuum-powered 
soft actuator featuring a dry adhesive, which can safely 
transfer the glass substrate by coupled contraction and 
twisting. To make these actuators, design concepts 
containing a monolithic air channel, oblique air chambers, and back-to-back bonding were presented. 
The dry adhesive samples underneath the actuator 
models were attached to flat glass, and the pull-off 
strength generated by the actuation of the models 
was measured along with the applied air pressure.
We present a summary of our findings below:
(1)The vacuum-powered soft actuator was intro -
duced. Various prototypes were suggested, and 
the soft actuator that can be easily manipulated 
by the negative pneumatic pressure was 
achieved.
(2)The facile detachment of the dry adhesive was 
confirmed. The experiment results revealed 
that a relatively low pull-off strength was gen-
erated compared to the generally used vertical 
detachment method of the artificial dry adhe -
sive, which differed based on the chamber 
angles of the models.
(3)The feasible application was illustrated. On the 
basis of (1) and (2), a novel glass transfer system 
was proposed with the 6-DOF robot arm, and 
its good performance was confirmed. This sys-
tem can not only lift a tilted glass without 
rupture but also safely deliver the glass to the 
target area.

YOO et al.Through this study, the pneumatic powered soft 
actuator with the dry adhesive, which is capable of 
attachment with glass, is presented from the feasible 
application perspective view. We believe that this 
study can provide insights into the usage of the pneu -
matic powered soft actuators as end effectors for the 
active adhesion control of artificial dry adhesives.
